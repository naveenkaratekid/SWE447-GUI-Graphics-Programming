Idea 1

Render a moving car

My idea is to render a modern car, and make it move. It will move forwards, right,left, and backwards. The wheels will also rotate as the car moves. My goal is to try to render a Tesla or a Toyota Camry is possible.


Proposed time frame

Week 1
-	Figure out which final project will be done, and research how to render a car

Week 2
-	Collect images for the car. Begin coding the car in JS. Ask for help from teacher or students when possible

Week 3
-	Begin to code the motion of the car, and the wheels to make them move


Week 4
-	Add texture to the car, as well as correct any other issues from previous steps

Week 5
-	Fancify car if possible



Implementation

-	Will most likely use Three.JS. It will be a web based application
